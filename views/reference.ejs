          During our time together Hyewon worked on critical projects both
          internal and consumer facing. In addition to producing high quality
          code output, Hyewon also has an eye for product design, and could
          independently drive changes to our UX on many of our products.
          <br /><br />
          Hyewon was a pleasure to work with. I recommend Hyewon to anyone
          looking for a solid frontend contributor with a high level of
          collaboration skills, high code quality, good growth trajectory, and
          desire to learn what it takes to get things done.
